GiottoUtils exports functionalities that are called internally by many
of the other packages in the Giotto ecosystem. These range from things
such as commonly used imports to pretty prints. Users should not need to
directly interact with this package.

``` r

devtools::install_github('drieslab/GiottoUtils')
```
